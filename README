Add-ons for this fork of the binutils

This fork aims at supporting the 128-bit version of the riscv target.
Summer 2022 efforts of the binutils guys have a bit complexified the issue,
but we have done our best to upgrade at a slow pace.
(Recent stuff not pushed yet, I'll do as soon as I can).

There are configuration issues that have to be dealt with when touching the
various autostuff files, so we have a docker image to ease the setup of an
appropriate environment without disturbing what is currently installed on
a machine.
Check the Dockerfile for that (configured to cross-build for rv64), it
currently only works for binutils(-gdb), but strangely enough, things are
easier with gcc.
Anyway, the first step is having a git-rebasable binutils, so let us focus
on that for now.


		   README for GNU development tools

This directory contains various GNU compilers, assemblers, linkers, 
debuggers, etc., plus their support routines, definitions, and documentation.

If you are receiving this as part of a GDB release, see the file gdb/README.
If with a binutils release, see binutils/README;  if with a libg++ release,
see libg++/README, etc.  That'll give you info about this
package -- supported targets, how to use it, how to report bugs, etc.

It is now possible to automatically configure and build a variety of
tools with one command.  To build all of the tools contained herein,
run the ``configure'' script here, e.g.:

	./configure 
	make

To install them (by default in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc),
then do:
	make install

(If the configure script can't determine your type of computer, give it
the name as an argument, for instance ``./configure sun4''.  You can
use the script ``config.sub'' to test whether a name is recognized; if
it is, config.sub translates it to a triplet specifying CPU, vendor,
and OS.)

If you have more than one compiler on your system, it is often best to
explicitly set CC in the environment before running configure, and to
also set CC when running make.  For example (assuming sh/bash/ksh):

	CC=gcc ./configure
	make

A similar example using csh:

	setenv CC gcc
	./configure
	make

REPORTING BUGS: Again, see gdb/README, binutils/README, etc., for info
on where and how to report problems.
